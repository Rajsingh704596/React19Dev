//! use Api hook-        (note- it work React version 19)
//# use is a React Api that lets you read the value of a resource like a Promise or Context.
//# useContext word replace with use and all work are same.

//* syntax-
//  const value = use(resource);

//$ Usage-
  //todo-  Reading Context with use-
    //^  When a context is passed to 'use', it works similarly to 'useContext'. 
    //^  While 'useContext'hook must be called at the top level of your component, `'use'hook can be called inside conditionals like if and loops like for.`this is the main advantage.
    //^ 'use' hook is preferred over 'useContext' hook because it is more flexible.
